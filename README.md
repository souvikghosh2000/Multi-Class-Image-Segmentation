## Overview

ResNet (Residual Networks) has been a cornerstone in deep learning, known for its ability to train intense neural networks effectively. In this project, we have taken the ResNet-R50 architecture and incorporated Dilated Convolution and Spatial Pooling to enhance its capabilities further. These modifications give the model an increased receptive field, allowing it to capture more contextual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Dilated Convolution:** We have introduced dilated convolutions to allow the model to expand its receptive field without sacrificing the spatial resolution of the input. This helps in capturing long-range dependencies in the data, making the model more robust to complex patterns.

- **Spatial Pooling:** Spatial pooling is incorporated to aggregate features from different spatial locations effectively. This aids in capturing diverse information from the input, making the model more adept at handling variations in the data.

## Performance

After training the customized ResNet-R50 on our dataset, we achieved an impressive accuracy of 90%. This showcases the effectiveness of our modifications in improving the model's feature extraction capabilities.
